#Known issues

As for now the only way to specify the home station is by changing the value of 
```home_station``` in ```TodayViewController.swift```

This app was developed on xCode 6.3.1 and since I am not enrolled on *Apple Developer program* I am not able to turn `App Groups` in the project settings which is the only way to share user settings between the application and the widget itself. Once I get xCode updated I will add settings functionality for the app.
